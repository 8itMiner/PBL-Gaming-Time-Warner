Just open a pull request with your contributions.
If they work when I test them, great! It will get merged in a week or so.

If not, and your pull request hasn't been merged after 2 weeks, that usually means something went wrong with your code.
Close your pull request if I haven't already, and just go through looking for bugs. If you're sure everything is right, open another pull request and contact me on my email.
